## MiBro-Own-Report-System (MORS)

The MORS is a server wide report system. You can report discorduser if they troll or anything else.

Server wide means that on every server on which MiBro is the reports will be noted.

 * At 3 reports, the reported user will be warned
 * At 5 or more, the moderators of the server will be informed
 * One user can report an other user only once
 
They will be an update soon which will extend this feature in some ways.

Command: `!report @someone your reason`

#### Commendations

But you can not only report people, you are also able to commend someone.

This is server wide too.
 * A user gets 3 commends: He earns free 250 XP (provided it's enabled)
 *             5 commends: He earns free 550 XP (provided it's enabled)
 *             n commends: ...maybe something special

#### User role self management

The feature allows members to add certain roles on their own. No permission or admin needed.

The Moderator can set up a list of roles which can be added.
Some applications:
 * Game roles
 * Music genre
