### Welcome channel

You can set a specific channel for the welcome announcement or you set it as private message.
If it's private, the bot sends the new member a private message with the welcome text.

Use `!welcomechannel #channel` to set it to a channel, or only `!welcomechannel` without any arguments to set it as private message
